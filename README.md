## What It Does

CosmosX is a full-stack Next.js 15 web app that turns space exploration into an interactive experience. A live 3D solar system greets you on arrival, rendered with 6,000+ stars and real Keplerian orbital dynamics. From there you can step through the history of space exploration, browse live mission news, simulate "what if" cosmic scenarios with an AI engine, and discover your cosmic crew role — all without leaving the browser.

The AI scenario engine uses **Groq (LLaMA 3.1-8b-instant)** to analyze user-defined hypotheticals and returns structured scientific breakdowns. Text-to-speech narration is optionally powered by **Deepgram** so every analysis can be read aloud. Space news is pulled in real time from the public **SpaceflightNewsAPI** — no API key required.

---

## Features

### 3D Solar System

A real-time WebGL universe built with Three.js and React Three Fiber. Six thousand stars twinkle in the background while all eight planets trace accurate elliptical orbits. The home page hero runs an animated solar system on a looping video backdrop — GPU instancing keeps it smooth even on mid-range hardware.

### AI Scenario Simulator

Type any "what if" about the cosmos — *What if Jupiter disappeared? What if Earth had two moons? What if the Sun were twice as massive?* — and the Groq-powered engine returns a structured breakdown: scientific explanation, physical impacts, a cascading timeline of effects, and a survivability rating. Three pre-built scenarios let you jump in immediately. Optional Deepgram text-to-speech narrates the full analysis on demand.

### Cosmic Timeline

An interactive chronological record of humanity's greatest space milestones — from Sputnik (1957) through Apollo 11, Voyager, Hubble, the ISS, James Webb, Chandrayaan-3, and a projected Mars colony (2050). Each entry expands to show mission facts and a full description in an alternating left-right layout.

### Live Space News

Aggregated articles from SpaceflightNewsAPI in an animated card grid. Filter by year from 2010 through the latest — every card shows the headline, summary, image, and a direct link to the source.

### Crew Registry & Role-Finder Quiz

Four fictional crew members with detailed dossiers, security clearances, and sci-fi bios. A 3-question role-finder quiz — drawing on live Earth–Mars and Earth–Jupiter distance data calculated from real orbital elements — assigns you one of three roles: **Quantum Propulsion Engineer**, **Deep Space Cartographer**, or **Astrobiologist**.

### Dark Pattern Detection

| Role | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Quantum Propulsion Engineer** | You think in systems and love pushing boundaries |
| **Deep Space Cartographer** | You chart the unknown and thrive on discovery |
| **Astrobiologist** | You search for life and ask the biggest questions |

### Contact / Sub-Space Transmission

A sci-fi themed contact form that animates an "uplink" progress bar on submission and responds with mission-control flavor text.

---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ · A free Groq API key (for the simulator) · Optional Deepgram key (for narration)

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/aruu28249-boop/cosmosx-.git)
cd cosmosx-
```

### 2. Install

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local`:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...your_key_here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...your_key_here   # optional — narration only
```

Get a free Groq key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) — the free tier is more than enough for personal use. Space news works without any key (public API).

Without a Groq key, the simulator still plays 3D visuals but the AI analysis panel shows a "not configured" message.

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

## Why CosmosX?

Most space apps give you static images and Wikipedia paragraphs. CosmosX is the only platform that combines a real-time 3D universe, AI-powered "what if" simulation, live mission news, and real orbital mechanics — all in a single browser tab, for free.

| Feature | CosmosX | NASA Eyes on the Solar System | SpaceEngine | Universe Sandbox | Star Walk 2 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Runs in the browser | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Desktop only | ❌ Desktop only | ❌ Mobile only |
| Real-time 3D solar system | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| AI "what if" scenario engine | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Text-to-speech narration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Live space news feed | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Historical mission timeline | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Real Keplerian orbital mechanics | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Role-finder quiz | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Free & open source | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Paid | ❌ Paid | ❌ Paid |
| No install required | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

The key gap CosmosX fills: **interactive AI reasoning about space**. No existing tool lets you ask "what if the asteroid belt disappeared?" and get a structured scientific analysis with a survivability rating in seconds. That's the core bet — curiosity-driven exploration, not just passive observation.

## Orbital Mechanics

Live planetary distances shown in the quiz are not hardcoded. `lib/orbital-mechanics.js` computes each planet's current ecliptic longitude using the **J2000.0 epoch** and mean orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity, mean anomaly, inclination), then derives the Earth–planet distance in AU via the law of cosines. The result updates on every quiz load.
